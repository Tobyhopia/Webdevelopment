        <h1>Chickens</h1>
        <hr>

        <p>The <b>chicken</b> is a domesticated species that arose from the <b>red junglefowl<sup>tm</sup></b>,
            originally
            from India.
            They have also partially hybridized with other wild species of <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowl">junglefowl</a>.
            Rooster and cock are terms for adult male birds, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that
            has
            been castrated is a capon. &leqq; &yuml; </p>

        <h2>Terminology</h2>

        <p><a href="https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ">Chickens</a> are one of the most common<sub>20</sub> and widespread
            domestic animals,
            with a
            total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018,[2]up from more than 19 billion in 2011. There are more chickens
            in the world than any other bird. There are numerous cultural references to chickensâ€”in myth, folklore, and
            religion, as well as in language and literature.

        <p>Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origin <b>theories</b> within South Asia,<br>
            Southeast Asia, and East Asia, [3] but the clade found in the Americas, <br>
            Europe, the Middle East, and Africa broriginated from the Indian subcontinent. <br>
            From ancient India, the chicken <br>
            spread to the brEastern Mediterranean. <br>
            They appear in ancient Egypt in the mid-15th century <br>
            BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having <br>
            come from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, <br>
            according to the annals of Thutmose III.[4][5][6] They are known <br>
            in ancient Greece from the 5th century BC.[7][8]</p>

        <h2>Etymology</h2>
        <p>According to <a href="my%202nd%20document.html">Merriam-Webster,</a> the term rooster (i.e. a roosting bird)
            originated in the mid- or late 18th century
            as a euphemism to avoid the sexual connotation of the original English cock,[22][23][24] and is widely used
            throughout North America.
            Roosting is the action of perching aloft to sleep at night.[25]</p>

        <p>Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a communal approach to the incubation of
            eggs and raising of
            young. Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a pecking order, with dominant
            individuals having priority
            for food access and nesting locations. Removing hens or roosters from a flock causes a temporary disruption
            to
            this social order
            until a new pecking order is established. Adding hens, especially younger birds, to an existing flock can
            lead
            to fighting and injury.</p>

        <h3>Vocalizations</h3>
        <p>When a rooster finds food, he may call other chickens to eat first. He does this by clucking in a high pitch
            as
            well as
            picking up and dropping the food. This behaviour may also be observed in mother hens to call their chicks
            and
            encourage them to eat.</p>
